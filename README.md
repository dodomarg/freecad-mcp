## Install addon

FreeCAD Addon directory is
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\FreeCAD\Mod\`
* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/FreeCAD/Mod/`
* Linux: `~/.FreeCAD/Mod/` or `~/snap/freecad/common/Mod/` (if you install FreeCAD from snap)

Please put `addon/FreeCADMCP` directory to the addon directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neka-nat/freecad-mcp.git
cd freecad-mcp
cp -r addon/FreeCADMCP ~/.FreeCAD/Mod/
```

When you install addon, you need to restart FreeCAD.
You can select "MCP Addon" from Workbench list and use it.

## Setting up Claude Desktop

Edit `claude_desktop_config.json` file.

For user.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freecad": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "freecad-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to save token, you can set `only_text_feedback` to `true` and use only text feedback.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freecad": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "freecad-mcp",
        "--only-text-feedback"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


For developer.
First, you need clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neka-nat/freecad-mcp.git
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freecad": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/freecad-mcp/",
        "run",
        "freecad-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

* `create_document`: Create a new document in FreeCAD.
* `create_object`: Create a new object in FreeCAD.
* `edit_object`: Edit an object in FreeCAD.
* `delete_object`: Delete an object in FreeCAD.
* `execute_code`: Execute arbitrary Python code in FreeCAD.
* `insert_part_from_library`: Insert a part from the [parts library](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library).
* `get_view`: Get a screenshot of the active view.
* `get_objects`: Get all objects in a document.
* `get_object`: Get an object in a document.
* `get_parts_list`: Get the list of parts in the [parts library](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library).

### Selection Buffer Tools

The selection buffer feature allows explicit user control over which objects the AI model operates on:

* `get_selection_buffer`: Get current selections from the buffer (non-destructive).
* `get_buffer_status`: Check if buffer has selections and metadata.
* `clear_selection_buffer`: Clear buffer after successful operations.
* `get_selection_workflow_strategy`: Get the recommended workflow for using selections.

#### Selection Workflow

1. User selects objects in FreeCAD GUI
2. User clicks "Send Selection to MCP" button in the addon toolbar
3. AI model uses `get_selection_buffer()` to retrieve selections
4. AI model performs operations, with retry capability using same selection data
5. After user confirms satisfaction, AI model calls `clear_selection_buffer()`

This workflow ensures:
- **Explicit user control**: Users decide exactly which objects to send
- **Selection persistence**: Data remains available for retries until cleared
- **Order preservation**: Maintains user's selection sequence
- **No data loss**: Selections persist even if model isn't actively listening
